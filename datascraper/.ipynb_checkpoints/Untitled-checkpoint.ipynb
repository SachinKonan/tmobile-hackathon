       "   'text': 'Was in town for work and had issues with my phone and service. This T-mobile is one of the earliest one to open; and they\\'re right at midtown, so I went in right at 9am. The customer service reps were knowledgeable and friendly. They helped me fixed my issues and also recommended great restaurants for my meeting (off topic). Thank you!! Ps- 5Church was a great suggestion. Thanks again!I came here to do an upgrade about two months ago. There really wasn\\'t anyone there, it was quiet, the place was well organized and the associates were very helpful through the upgrade process. Although, I had a bit of trouble trying to get my new device, #TeamMagenta was there to answer any questions that I may have had. I\\'ll be going here from now on to do any upgrades!!!I walked in to upgrade my phone and asked how long it would take to make the transfer of my backed up data. I was told 10-15 minutes. The girl helping me was texting while helping me and didn\\'t know what she was doing. She screwed up the transfer 4 times until I asked a manager to help. He didn\\'t know what he was doing either and by the time we got out of the store it took 1.5 hours. Terrible service, I am extremely unsatisfied and would NOT recommend coming to this location. If you want better service hopefully there\\'s a better T-mobile location that actually knows what they are doing.Maybe I got lucky, but my rep, a young man named \\'Houston\\' was not only super friendly, but hooked me up in a flash. \\xa0Very friendly and accommodated my needs extremely well.I called today asking if a certain promotion still exists. The customer representative on the line said,\"No, it ended yesterday. Bye.\" Bye. Really? It would have been courteous if she asked if I had any other questions (which in fact I did). Very rude.I had two awful experiences from two different locations. The one located inside Cumberland mall, sold me things I already told I don\\'t need and now, I have a second line that can\\'t be removed. The second location was Tmobile at 5th street, where I thought this guy made sure to add my insurance back on. 6 months later, I found out he never did. Luckily, the phone was still under warranty. I was so close to shopping for a different carrier after being a loyal T-mobile customer for 14 yrs until I met Jamin and Whitney. Both spent almost an hour with me on 2 different issues that they had to correct because of some idiot & incompetent former employee. If I could just reach their managers and asked that they should be recognized for their 5-star stellar customer service performance...!Short version: Slow, inefficient. \\xa0Avoid unless you enjoy waiting.Long version: \\xa0I came in around 11:40 to get a sim card for a phone I had purchased elsewhere. \\xa0There wasn\\'t a line per se...just a collection of individuals around the store - maybe 3 people ahead of me though. \\xa0Around 30 minutes later I\\'m \\'next\\' in \\'line.\\' \\xa0The clerk at this point decides to help both myself and the lady she was working with simultaneously. \\xa0I normally applaud this sort of multi-tasking...but it was done so badly and so rudely that she really should not have bothered.Another 15 minutes go by, during most of which I\\'m not entirely sure if my new sim card is being acquired or not.Finally I\\'m handed a sim card and told to try it out - I\\'m done.The sim card was free due to the wait I experienced - which is why this review is 2 stars instead of 1.This store needs some new management and staff. Seems like T-Mobile is hiring uneducated delinquents off the streets.. No one is knowledgeable about current products or current offers. For having a good location this place sucks and I will not be returning unless some major changes are made.Worst. T-mobile. Store. Ever. Horrible service, bad attitudes. Whether you call or go in these people just can\\'t seem to get it right. I don\\'t know why the guys here seem to be so bitter and angry, but I\\'ve always had bad experiences here. Each year I try to give them a second chance and each year they #FAIL. T-Mobile prides themselves in having awesome service, that\\'s why my family has stuck with them for well over a decade. So to go into a store or call into a store and get \\xa0bad attitudes just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. AND they just never seem to have enough employees to handle the amount of customers. There will literally be one associate juggling, or not juggling, 5 people. If the person is unable to multitask you could literally be standing in queue for 35+ minutes. There is a caveat though, if one of their \"friends\" or if certain customers come in they\\'ll drop everything in attend to them. Unless it\\'s President Obama or First Lady Michelle, or maybe Oprah then attend to customers in the order they appear before you. \\xa0Like literally, if it\\'s not one of those three people (Barack, Michelle, Oprah), then attend to customers in the order of arrival. Not to mention they are almost ALWAYS out of phones. They hardly have the newer phones in stock. You\\'re in the city center, literally off Peachtree Street and yet you can\\'t keep the main new phones in stock? That ish cray?!. lol. Oh and the '},\n",

       "   'text': 'cherry on top-- PARKING IS LIMITED, very LIMITED. *sigh*. Please do better. This store makes T-mobile look bad.Worst tmobile store ever. \\xa0I have been a tmobile customer for over 13 years and after going to this store was tempted to switch carriers. \\xa0I have been in this specific store 4 times and had the worst customer service I have experienced in my life. One girl was texting when I was trying to ask questions, another time they closed the store before it was scheduled to, and was ignored because this workers friend was there and they were to busy talking about their weekend to assist me.Yep, these other reviews are consistent. Poor customer service. I was visiting from out of town and needed a phone charger. I went to the store and 2 employees were \"helping\" a customer (well one guy was helping the customer and the other employee was just talking to him while he helped). I looked around the store for a couple of minutes looking for the charger I needed but couldn\\'t find one. While me and one other customer stood in line for 5 minutes or so no one ever looked up to say \"I\\'ll be right with you\" or \"what can I help you with?\" I eventually walked up to the employee that was just talking to the other employee and asked if they had the charger I needed. She said yes then when to the back to get it. While waiting I heard the employee next to me (still dealing with the aforementioned customer) interrupt the customer explaining her situation saying \"Wait, I don\\'t understand what are you saying, what\\'s the problem?\". When the employee helping me came back with the charger I got \"this one?\" and \"I wish you would have said that\\'s what you needed\" instead of \"sorry for your wait\" and \"thank you for coming to T-Mobile\"\\'. It doesn\\'t end there. I called the next day to see what time they opened and the voicemail tells you to press 5 for store details. I did and it just looks back to the same recording. I tried pressing 3 to \"connect to the store\" and it just rang....no voicemail.My phone is still under warranty and the touch screen started to separate from the keyboard. There are two remedies and both of them involve going to a T-Mobile store to confirm with an associate that the phone is defective.Option A is to do in in-store exchange. Of course, that\\'s dependent upon them having one in stock.Option B is to have one shipped from T-Mobile and then send back the broken one.Of course, the first option is preferable, but having one shipped really isn\\'t that big of a deal and they make it super easy.I came here to start the process and the person who helped me never even asked my name or looked up my account. He looked at my phone, told me they didn\\'t have any in stock, then proceeded to call other stores. 5 - 10 minutes later he found one at a store nearby, although I was apprehensive about going because it wasn\\'t an actual T-Mobile store (and most likely not authorized to do an in-store warranty exchange).By the way, he spent all this time looking for a phone without even checking my account. That would have been a great way to get my name (and to make sure that I was even within the warranty period to go through the exchange process).Ultimately I decided to go to the Buckhead store so they could help me have one shipped. Amazingly, they had one in stock and I did the exchange there. I\\'m not sure who he called... or if he actually called the right location. All I know is they\\'ve got a lot to work on in Midtown.#Yelp365 - 67/365After years of being a loyal T Mobile customer, and dealing with a phone with horrible reception since August, when my super awesome phone was taken in my bag as I was robbed at gunpoint. \\xa0So I was super excited when my husband visited this store and one of the guys happily told him that we were two weeks away from a free upgrade.And I went in today to take advantage of that. \\xa0Unfortunately, there were complications because I had temporarily gotten a new phone in August after the robbery and then returned it when I found our old back ups. \\xa0However, Darrell was great - he explained everything multiple times to make sure that I understood it was a function of the system, and why even if he overrode the system, I would have trouble with the mail-in refund, and I still wouldn\\'t get the lowest price. \\xa0So he took care of upgrading the other phones on the account, then connected me to customer service and helped me straighten everything out. \\xa0AWESOME SERVICE.One star because I DID walk out with a phone. \\xa0The manager (young black girl, with hazel contact lenses, and long curly hair weave), has the worst attitude I have ever experienced. \\xa0I think she must be mad because she is using her college degree to \"control\" cell phone customers. \\xa0She actually almost finished this sentence \"You always come in here with...\". \\xa0I go there about once a year, and \"I\\'m always\".... \\xa0She had the nerve to tell me, after me telling her that I have stage 4, terminal breast cancer, \"Sorry to hear that\" \"goodbye\" \"have a nice day\", in the most condiscending manner. \\xa0I don\\'t have to be happy to walk into a store for service..GTFOH! \\xa0I\\'m bothered beca'},\n",

Complaint filed anyway, we\\'ll see what happens...Yes, I\\'m heated!!!My G1 phone got doused during the rainstorm last week -- I was, alas, unaware that they were so sensitive to water -- so I visited this T-Mobile store to buy a new handset. \\xa0The saleswoman was very friendly and knew their selection of phones well, directing me toward a Motorola Cliq as their new Android-with-a-keyboard model. \\xa0I am now home and back in business phone-wise!The reason for only three stars was that my visit wound up taking 50 minutes for what was probably only ten or fifteen minutes of productive time. Though the individual salespeople were each quite competent and friendly -- the good service, by the way, whether in person or from their telephone support, has been the reason I continue to stick with T-Mobile -- but there were not enough of them for the mid-afternoon crowd that wound up appearing. It might just have been a fluke of when I happened to walk in the door, but at least for the hour I was there the store could have used several more staffpeople. Thus my rating it \"A-OK\" with three stars rather than being tempted to go higher.Worst experience ever. I went in the store to start a new service. The employee was nasty. Not pleasant at all and didn\\'t describe anything. She said my service would be the same as AT&T. I brought the phone home and it didn\\'t work in my house at all! I called the store and spoke with the associate who sold me the phone. She said I could bring it back and pay the restocking fee. I didn\\'t think that was fair as she had lied to me. She said only the manager could wave the fee and she had left for the day and would be back the next day. I visited the store the next day and the manager was not in. There wasn\\'t even an assistant manager there! Two days in a row. I called customer service and they said that only the store could issue my refund of the restocking fee. The manager finally called me the next day and said that she was unable to issue the refund either. I went into the store the next day and explained the situation. Although there were notes in the computer all about my situation, she refused to issue the refund again. I called customer device again and they too said no one in their whole chant could help me. Literally, the worst cell phone provider ever! Stay away from t mobile!!!!!! And from the manager of this store.I went here yesterday to get a new iPhone. The lady checking me out had a very bad attitude. She was upset that I had a $20 instead of a $10! They also never explain things to you before hand and just assume that you know things. All they want to do is offer you things so you put more money in their pockets. Never going back here.I\\'m giving them a short and disappointed review. I\\'ve been a T Mobile customer for 2 yrs, have a Sidekick that is slowy deterorating and need to upgrade my phone. I\\'m not unrealistic and can\\'t blame this location for being sold out of the phone I want, but they should have at least been helpful enough to SELL me on a phone that I would then go buy on the internet. I wanted to spend less money per month on my cell phone plan, and all I needed was for the sales rep to help me figure out what would be best. That was asking too much, apparently. I left after 15 minutes of this chick telling me that \"a lot has changed since you bought your original plan, maybe you should switch\" but then not helping me make the switch. I went home, dialed 611 on my phone and the customer service guy was much more helpful.I know T Mobile is not usually like this, so my advice is to go to a different location or call the 800 number for help.'},\n",

Why am I having to wait an hour for something that should take me 3 mins to do? This is absolutely ridiculous. Who is managing this store and why hasn\\'t he/she been replaced? Complaint after complaint about long waiting times and one thing is clear, they don\\'t care.I have been a T-Mobile customer for 10 years or so and I have always been impressed with their product and quality but is their face-to-face team members in their stories is what always impressed me. \\xa0This is the second time I\\'ve been to this location and I have never experienced service like this! Thomas and the store manager TJ went so far above and beyond to make my experience the best it could be. From educating me on all the devices to providing me all the current offers from Samsung and T-Mobile. TJ even went to another store to pick up a tablet that want in stock at their location. Just blown away with the customer service at this location! They run a tight ship with a very fun, light yet professional attitude and knowledge. This is the way customer interaction should be. Well done guys! \\xa0We\\'ll done.Horrible location! I spent almost three hours in here, ended up leaving pissed and unsatisfied. The rep clearly didn\\'t know what he was doing. I was told 4 different prices for a line. The manager was incapable of helping or rectifying the situation. They are so clueless when it comes to efficient customer service. This whole experience makes me want to cancel T-Mobile. I will never go to this location again! It so sad that they are the closest location to my home.So according to their website, there is a zero minute wait at this location. So I went in, and was asked if I needed something. Yes, I told him I was there to move over six devices from a competitor. I was told to wait...While I waited, the store had only one other customer, and five employees standing around. One was on her phone, while another was sweeping. Multiple times we tried to get someone to help us, and nothing. So yes, there is a zero minute wait to be greeted, but that\\'s it. I honestly don\\'t know how these people get a job. Not only are they worthless with their approach to customer service but they looked like they sleep on the streets.Run from T-Mobile. Don\\'t even consider switching from whatever carrier you have (no matter how bad you think it is) to this nightmare. You have no idea until you experience it, and, trust me, you do not want to. The staff and managers are very nice here, especially knowledgeable employees Dexter and Ronnie, but they are working for a lame carrier. The cell phone reception was spotty at best in many locations in the Atlanta area -- \\xa0except in the T-Mobile store (yes, I got lots of bars inside this store and was able to make a call without the call dropping). I am mystified how T-Mobile stays in business.So I\\'m making a few updates on T-Mo again...In recent news - T-Mo now lets you go month to month, EVEN when you get a new phone (for which you can pay in full or create a per month payment plan if you prefer), and when I was surprised to discover that my last two year contract would be up today (yay!) and I figured out how make my plan more economical as well, I decided to enlist my personal IT guru, Adam R formerly of Yelp, to help me pick a new phone. He loves and knows about \"this stuff\" and I, well, don\\'t.The guy that helped us when we went Sun so we could handle everything before my contract was up and ensure I was going mo-to-mo - I wish I remembered his name but I think it starts with a K - was awesome and super-helpful. We had an idea going in of what I wanted and that\\'s exactly what I ended up getting - the Galaxy s4. This is my first touch screen (I know, I know) and \\xa0I am definitely not adept at using it yet, but it is really cool. I got black and a bright pink case for it (yay!) and the boys got me initially set up and now I get to play with a new toy!Retail price on the phone in full \\xa0is high so I opted to split it up. This phone is definitely bigger than my crackberry but I\\'m getting used to it.I need to go back and get more help on a few things but feel good about the help I will receive.Slowly, but surely, things are looking up for this location. It\\'s still not an ideal set-up and I\\'ve experienced better service other places. Regardless, they get stuff done here.Yeah, you have to wait a little while... and you don\\'t always get greeted... and it can be crowded... and the employees sometimes seem inattentive. After all that, it\\'s been my experience that your issue will be resolved. Sometimes the end justifies the means. Yeah, I\\'d prefer to see more rainbows and unicorns. I guess that\\'s just one of those things you have to put up with to be connected.I had been with T-Mobile for eleven years and they have provided good service. I have to periodically call them to find out if they have better pricing. In Oct \\'14 they said the $20/mo per phone was their best pricing. When I got things rolling to move my phone service'},\n",

(Give T-Mobile a call and they\\'ll eMail you the numbers to \"Un-Lock\" your cell phone) AT&T offers $$ for signing on, which takes some of the bite out of the transition costs. \\xa0Be sure to check out what the other mobile carriers are offering regularly.

My review is solely based on T-Mobile as a whole and is an explanation of my particular circumstance. I purchased a t-mobile phone about 1 year ago. At the time I was living in the Buckhead area of Atlanta. About a week ago, I purchased a home about 15 minutes from my previous location in the Kirkwood community of Atlanta. This area is very established and part of Atlanta at large. It is also about a mile from Decatur square. In other words, this isn\\'t a rural area.Upon moving in, I noticed not having any signal whatsoever, with the exception of a few fleeting 2G instances. The phone had no data and no solid ability to make a call. I called T-Mobile to investigate. The first time I was told there was a \"trouble ticket\" currently being serviced in the area. They would get back to me after they heard the results of the repair. They did and asked me to go back to the house and see how much my service had improved.The service was the same.I called in again a couple of days later and was told a new service request would be initiated. I was to give them a few days and then call back on Friday. I complied and today is Friday. In the back of my mind I wondered why the'},\n",

There were no planned upgrades for my area for the next 6 months at least and the engineers have confirmed my area has poor service. I was forwarded to \"terminations\". Once I reached this new department and told them my whole story again, they informed me I \"had two options\", the first being me finding someone to \"take on my contract for me\" or, if that was \"not an option\" I could pay the $200 cancellation fee for \"wanting to get out of my contract\". At no time during my experience with T-Mobile have I ever been spoken to so short and cold. I have enjoyed the service for the most part with little trouble(except being over-charged every month and having to call in to get credited). I of course take issue with the idea of paying the contract cancellation fee and was told that I could either \"write to t-mobile\" as they don\\'t \"talk about cancellations over the phone \"anymore\" or I could just \"deal with it\" and pay the fee. In hopes for a remedy to this situation, my first step is to post here. If no remedy will be found, I will next offer my experience to shoppers entering the T-Mobile retail locations. If anything, you need to know what a company treats you like when things don\\'t go perfectly for them...and I want you to know, this is how you\\'ll be treated. Of course, I would be perfectly content to move on from this if they waive the bogus \"early term\" fee. It\\'s your choice, T-Mobile, nickel and dime me for $200 or lose future customers. Let me know!Terrible customer service. \\xa0We came in for a scheduled appointment on a Saturday. \\xa0First, there were only two employees working even though there were six total counters. \\xa0In Buckhead. \\xa0On a Saturday. \\xa0We were not greeted when we entered. \\xa0When the service technician finally acknowledged our presence, she said she\\'d been \"stuck with customers\" and had not gotten to eat lunch; we would have to wait \"at least an hour\" for our scheduled appointment.'},\n",

Horrible service. They literally refused to help on the off chance it might hurt their ratingKiara Ashanti Dobbs is a rude,ratchett weave wearing mess.. she\\'s in the wrong profession .she needs to be playing for the Falcons,instead.no type of customer service whatsoever.Heidi P., I\\'m sorry that you had such an unpleasant experience here. :(Mine was the opposite, with my first visit being the day that the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was released last year. I came during my lunch hour, as I just could not stand to wait until the end of the day. I even ran over to Arby\\'s and grabbed a roast beef sandwich that I shoved in my mouth as I drove down Hammond Drive to T-Mobile, to ensure that I wouldn\\'t starve to death later in the afternoon, all for a phone.The store wasn\\'t packed but apparently some other geniuses picked up on my cerebral signals to come during lunch, because there were three others waiting for their own shiny phablet. \"Damn them! I need to get in and out,\" I thought to myself. But I held myself together and checked my mini-mirror to see if I had bits of sandwich in between my teeth in the meantime. Then an employee finally asked if she could help and I told her what she already expected. \"I want to buy the new Samsung Note.\" \"Okay, which color? The white or black?\" \"Oh! Well, I hadn\\'t really thought about that too carefully. But you know what? My phones have always been black or some dark color. And I have been envious of iPhone owners with their colorless phones. I, too, shall enjoy this benefit, now that it is within my reach.\" Okay... So maybe I don\\'t really talk that robotic in real life, but the conversation did go in that same vein.She brought out my phone and pulled it out for me to see. \"Oooohhh. Aaahhhh. Okay! I will take it! Outright, with no contracts.\" No questions or correcting my term usage. The kind lady then deftly programmed a bunch of things in my phone, ensuring that my account sync with Google would guarantee a smooth transition. I saw all my calendar and contact information appear on the new phone and was pretty pumped. (I did back up text messages and photos beforehand.) She then noticed that I carried an HTC Sensation 4G in my hand and asked if I wanted to turn it in for a credit towards my phone, which was crazy expensive (but I had anticipated it and was ready with the moo-lah). I had thought about giving the phone to my smartphone-lacking little sister, but given its laggy performance and the $70 credit that I stood to gain, I handed over that bad boy with almost no hesitation. She rang me up, applied the credit, and announced the total. I confidently gave her my card to swipe and after signing, she wished me good luck with the phone and I was out of the door.It has been eight months since this whole thing took place and I still love my phone as much as I did then. I also have been a loyal customer for a decade and the service that I received here was nothing short of the attention that I typically get from this mobile carrier.Quinton was the one who serviced me he was very unhelpful and did not seem to care about me, my needs, or the service I needed. I went in to get a new phone and knew exactly what I wanted the Galaxy s7 and Quinton appeared to be aloof about helping me but ran through the steps while constantly being on his phone. I was switching from Verizon and when I mentioned my Father had TMobile and would be paying my bill he rudely stated \"must be nice\" and that was probably the most he said the whole time in the store. He never walked me though any process or stated what was going on, just told me to do this and that. \\xa0Every time I looked to him to ask a question he was absorbed into his phone and made me feel very uncomfortable. It would of been nice of him to hold a conversation or tell me about the phone. I tried to ask questions but was shot down with one word answers, what ever was going on on his phone had to of been more important then doing his job. I made it known I was not happy with the price that was offered and tried to take measures to lower it and he offered NO suggestions. He had NO PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE I asked about the waterproof function of the Galaxy and he said \"it wasn\\'t and would not recommend putting it in water\", when Tmobile did the test with the phone to submerge it and see how deep it can go. I don\\'t understand how a trained (and paid) employee could be so unfriendly and unhelpful, I was extremely disappointed. My boyfriend suggested getting a case and screen protector, but I said lets go somewhere else where I did not want to deal with him one moment longer.He was not paying attention to the process that was going on and took my photo ID with out returning it. (God only know what he was doing the whole time he was \"servicing\" \\xa0I realized after leaving the store and called to make sure it was still the'},\n",

       "   'text': 're and spoke to Quinton so he knew I was coming back. Quinton was out front chatting with another person, not an employee and as soon as I approached him he turned his back rudely. I went inside and the person who I talked with seemed to be very displeased with him, he definitely should not be working in customer service or sales this whole process was so painfully awkward. Maybe next time Ill try the location inside the mall. Tmobile reached out to me with a survey and I let them know how dissatisfied I was and requested to have the manager of the store reach out to me.Ugh. Came here because it is near home and to avoid TMobile in the mall. Good thing I went in knowing what I wanted because if they had to sell me on anything I may have abandoned ship. They maybe almost did too.I went in and asked for the Google Nexus, because I had already done some research and decided that\\'s what I wanted. The employee said \"I think we have one left.\" He brought it out for me and I said awesome. I told him I wanted to buy the phone outright without making any change to my contract. He quickly and frigidly corrected me, saying, \"We don\\'t have contracts. They\\'re called plans.\" Okay, I\\'m sure your marketing people told you to let people know that you\\'re not using the word \"contract\" anymore but you could have said that in like 12 different nicer ways.That was pretty much the last full sentence we shared. He then proceeded to set up my phone and pretty much never look at me or speak to me during the process. Even when he had to wait for something to load or pop up on his computer screen - nothing. If I were him I might have said, \"It\\'ll be just a minute for this to load...\" Or \"I\\'m restarting it now...\" Walk me through the process or SOMETHING. This is the perfect scenario for all those stories you hear about people flipping out in cell phone stores. I asked for a screen cover.. Another $18 later he\\'s applying it for me. If putting those things on wasn\\'t one of the most facepalm, hair-ripping activities ever, I would have said forget I\\'ll go to eBay. I think like $16 of it was actually labor costs built in anyway. Maybe that\\'s worth it in a sick world.Why do TMobile employees hate everything? Is it because Catherine Zeta Jones is no longer reppin\\' them? That\\'d make me sad too actually... Or maybe your brain is just melting from all the hot pink on your walls. The communication was so nonexistent that I didn\\'t even realize we were done when he gave me the phone. Again no, \"thanks for picking TMobile,\" nor, \"get the eff outta here.\" If I wasn\\'t stuck in a contract OOoPS I mean PLAN for another year I WOULD get the eff out of TMob!Marquis was who helped us with our lines, and he did a really good job, I recommend this place.I had the worst experience this last week when I went there. Customer service was really bad and that big black dude was playing his games while helping me. This is extremely rude. He never asked me if I need help with anything else. He acted as if I was a burden on him.On top of it when I post them a yelp comment they just simply deleted it instead of being apologetic about it.T-Mobile should take notice of it and save their name by shutting down this pathetic store.Rude, pushy salesman from the moment we walked in. We were interested in plan options... Instead he went to the back and grabbed a device before we even made any decisions. As we left, we heard him loudly comment that he \"hated when people wasted\" his time. Funny, considering he walked up to us before we were even ready and we were in the store for less than 5 minutes. \\xa0We were given no time to browse the store.This is the location next to the mall located in the center with the Best Buy. \\xa0 I have been with TMobile for over 8 years. \\xa0This location happens to be located near my home, and it is more convenient than the mall location. \\xa0Quite often, I visit this store to either add a service, make inquiry about my android, or buy additional accessories (blue tooth, chargers, etc). \\xa0However, customer service is greatly lacking. \\xa0I have never had a pleasant experience in that particular store. Employees do not greet you, nor do they smile, and they barely make eye contact when dealing with you one on one. \\xa0Unless they are taking money, they have no desire to help or to want to help. \\xa0Each question or request appears to be a hassle unless I am shopping for a new phone. There is no sense of urgency to assist the next customer, and they certainly do not pay attention to the order in which customers enter the store. \\xa0The one time I spoke up about being skipped, the Tmobile employee rolled her eyes at me and dismissed my comment. \\xa0Store employees can be observed texting or playing on their own phone while helping customers. \\xa0Their answer for everything is to call customer service. \\xa0Most of the time the answers store employees give me in the store do not match the answers I receive after calling customer service. \\xa0For example, my boyfriend and I, both Tmobile customers, entered the store together to request the process for combining our bill. \\xa0Store employees told us that we'},\n",

Super nice and very hospitable. \\xa0Thanks!This store is very small and so there is not a lot of staff so the service to get help is VERY slowHowever, once you are being helped the staff is very knowledgeable and experienced about about getting your needs or issues resolved.I would ask for Davin.Great customer service today from Cornell! I hope I said that right:)He juggled several customers on his own, and handled a few rude customers perfectly. He made sure I left with my new phone protected! Awesome customer service!!!This T-Mobile store is located inside the same, huge shopping center with TJ Max, Target, etc., on the corner of Austell Rd and E-W Connector. On my Google Maps Navigator, it says it\\'s in the middle of the road. But it\\'s in that shopping center. You can find near 5 Guy\\'s Burgers.I got a new phone that I wanted to activate with their Pre-Pay service. Due to a bug in T-Mobile\\'s Web-site, I got stuck mid-way through the sign up process. And it wouldn\\'t accept my sim card anymore when I tried again. I had a horrendous time dealing with T-Mobile Pre Pay Customer Service over the phone. Their call quality sucked, couldn\\'t talk loud enough, and had a thick accent. Not only that, the rep was curt and rude to me. Basically, I had to go to the store to get my sim card fixed.Going to the store felt like a different experience. The guy who helped me was a white dude with moppy hair. I can\\'t remember his name. Anyway, he was friendly and helpful. He did everything for me, got me a new sim card, called the right people to fix my number porting problem, and did everything to get stuff fixed. I came out of here pleased.This kid on their sales team poorly explained a promotion, or purposely lied to us for the sake of getting a commission check. Now we are stuck paying for a beats headphone he pushed us into getting because it was supposedly \"free\". Went back to speak to manager and he explained how the promotion \"actually worked\" and he couldnt do anything about it. Props to you for fooling your customers so you can get your check! Wont be returning here again.I went into this store to upgrade my phone that has been causing me nonstop issues since I got it 6 months ago. (If you\\'re thinking of getting the galaxy s6 edge, dont. This is my second and it\\'s awful) I didn\\'t think it would be any issue since I was told when signing up that I would be on the jump on demand program which allows you to upgrade 3 times a year at no charge. Upon entering the extremely crowded store I was greeted by a lady, her tag said she was a manager but it seems like all of their tags say that. I explained to her that my phone has been having problems and that I would like to upgrade so she pulled up my account and informed me that whoever activated my phone simply failed to put the jump on demand feature on my account even though the rest of my family had the feature. This was clearly no fault of mine as I was told I would have this feature and a t-mobile employee didn\\'t put it on. I explained to her that this wasn\\'t my fault and I can\\'t go another year and a half with this phone. She used a bunch of t-mobile terms that I don\\'t understand (I don\\'t work there so don\\'t assume I know these terms, make it understandable to someone who knows nothing about tmobile) and when I asked her to explain she simply kept repeating the same thing and told me she couldn\\'t do anything. I immediatly drove to the store on Powder Springs Rd next to the Fitness 19 and the employees were more than happy to help me and understood my situation, they explained everything and it\\'s been many weeks but the issue has now been resolved. Don\\'t go to this store, they won\\'t help, go to the one on Powders Springs Rd.My Hot Spot died so I went in to check if they could tell me if it was replaceable or fixable. Unfortunately, I am a year into a two-year contract and it was out of warranty. One of the sales people looked at it and thought that the battery was defective so he suggested checking at a nearby Batteries+Plus before I replaced it. He said if they couldn\\'t help, to check Target or Wal-Mart because it would be cheaper to purchase it there. He could have tried selling me a new Hot Spot but suggested a cheaper alternative. Thanks!!This store and the experience was worth the drive! Exodo (Exodus) was the gentleman whom assisted me. He answered all of my questions, took the time to go through my plan to make sure I was getting the best rate (plan) and was super enthusiastic to help each person that walked in the store (this was while I waiting for my contact info to be transferred in the back.) If you go, ask for him! You will wonder why there aren\\'t more employees working at T-Mobile like Exodo!This store does a lot of lying, about the price your bill will be, and about the discounts you will receive. They will end up losing tmobile customers. They lied to me about promotions and about my total bill cost, in order to sell. Considering calling \\xa0the FCC, buyer '},\n",

       "   'text': 'Let\\'s start this one off with a good ole\\' GRRRR. \\xa0Bc I\\'m totally angry.This is the TMobile inside Perimeter Mall.. 2nd floor next door to Dillards.I am not 100% sure why I\\'m giving this place two stars instead of just one. Maybe I\\'m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk up my extreme annoyance partially to the actual phone. (MyTouch 4G if it matters..) However, this review is about customer service.I stopped 3 or 4 days ago, and also today. Both times, I walked in and there were only two employees on the floor - both helping other customers already. \\xa0I don\\'t know if it\\'s ME or if it\\'s cell phone stores in general or just this place specifically.. but I felt a general lack of caring customer service.The first day, I walked in and they sort of half-assed addressed me as some other customer that came in earlier whom they thought I was. I had to tell them \"no, not me\" more than once. I just waited for a few minutes for someone to be available, and the store rep closest to me addressed another guy who was walking around, and said \"We\\'ll be right with you, sir.\" \\xa0I\\'m not sure if that guy came in before or after me, honestly, but regardless, they didn\\'t tell me I was next after him or what. So, I moved to the next desk to stand \"in line\" - really, I made my own line by standing right behind the people who were being helped at the time.The same guy helped me both days.. friendly enough but BOTH times he answered personal phone calls on his cell phone with one hand, WHILE trying to fix my phone with the other hand. Is this allowed because this is a phone store? Whether it is or not: Super unprofessional. You let that sh!t go to voice mail, come on!In addition, every question I asked seemed to fail. I asked for a case, \"We don\\'t have cases for that phone.\"I asked for screen covers, \"We don\\'t have any that fit your phone.\" No offer for a screen cover that I could trim, either. I asked for a mini SD card, and he steered me away from purchasing theirs, because he said it was more expensive at TMobile than other places. What about the iPhone that is supposed to finally be coming out on TMobile? \\xa0Nope.. he didn\\'t want to tell me about something he had no idea when they were going to start carrying. \\xa0Besides, he said the iPhone is not even that much greater than other phones anymore.I appreciate the honesty, but it felt a little more like he didn\\'t want to do his job and help me find this stuff.. he just wanted me to go somewhere else for each piece.Then TODAY, besides the personal phone call reprisal, a co worker came up to him to give him money for some donation thing, and he had a friend show up who stood behind me. Both of these things must have distracted him because while he was replacing my sim card (so I could use my old phone for a day until a replacement phone came) somehow he lost the credit card sized card that the sim card comes in. So he typed some stuff into the computer and retried, and retried.. and finally said, \"Okay, I\\'ll finish this later.\" .....Which I assumed meant I was good to go, and what he was referring to would not affect me....I confirmed with him my temporary phone was ready to go, and that I would get the replacement the next day. I said thanks and left. \\xa0Since I hadn\\'t used the old phone since earlier in the week, the battery was dead. I got in the car and plugged it in to charge it. When it was ready, I turned it on and made a call to my Mother. Instead, I was directed to TMobile. The phone was not turned on!!! He \"finished\" with me and sent me on my way with my temporary phone not activated. \\xa0PISSED.This experience over both days is best compared to me walking up to a \"friend\" who \"knows stuff\" about phones and asking him to figure out what\\'s wrong with it. Then the friend removes the battery, puts it back in, restarts it.. and tells me not to waste my money on anything else. Again, I don\\'t feel like he gave a crap about my phone or me, and I will be finding a different TMobile store to help me, going forward.Went to Tmobile in \\xa0Perimeter mall, walked around for 5 minutes, no one approach me. If I was Secret shopper they would get low scores.Please save your time and don\\'t come to this store. People here are extremely irresponsible for their works. I strongly not recommend going to this store for any reasons.I told them I need a pay as you go card. They told me there will be 26 dollars due today which includes 10 dollars prepaid fee. I said okay, then I said can I port in my number later this month. They said fine. However, when I finally port in number, the remaining balance shows zero, yes, zero. Totally waste of my money and time. Fucking liars!!!As a new T-Mobile customer (just left Verizon two days ago) I am still skeptical of the service. We needed to exchange a new iphone and was not able to return to our original store of purchase so we came to the Perimeter Store. \\xa0We were first assisted by a female associate left the store then returned and was assisted by the wonderful Greg. \\xa0He explained everything thoroughly and then informed us of T-Mobile Tuesday, \\xa0The T-Mobile app, \\xa0he helpe'},\n",

It\\'s the third time I\\'ve come and all they say or do is to go to the one inside the mall or call customer service.And once I do, they tell me that they could\\'ve have done it there- like changing a phone number or SIM card. Today I walked in before they close and I could see the two young men putting their heads down and looking at us saying \"no\" while we were walking towards the store. Once we got in, we didn\\'t even get greeted and one of them sat behind the counter... and once I asked for what I needed... guess what the reply was.. call customer service- we can\\'t help you here.Last time they gave me the wrong information and when I brought it to their attention, all they did wasn\\'t point fingers. Useless, unprofessional and very rude.The people working there have no clue, but they are nice and try their best. The problem with this and other T-mobile stores is the selection is piss poor. They sell Samsung phones, but no charger or cables? What is that about? More and more their stores are just outlets to sell phones only, and I can do that on Amazon, PLUS buy all the accessories. Going to a T-Mobile store is just a tremendous waste of time.I specifically asked the clerk or whatever they call themselves if they had SAMSUNG BRAND CHARGERS, and she walked me over to the pathetic display case to show me some BELKIN CHARGERS. The response is supposed to be \"No, but we have other brands...\" Not leading someone to the land of nothingness.This retail location is inside the Perimeter Mall, a couple doors down from Dillards upper level. \\xa0Went in here to get a billing issue straightened out for a friend\\'s mom, and she was so confused about the bill/charges/etc that we needed to see someone in person. \\xa0Greeted professionally as we walked in, and didn\\'t have to wait at all. \\xa0Renata is probably one of the best customer service reps at this location. She took the extra time to go over everything and explain the plan options and what was/was not included, and got us hooked up with the right phone and plan for what Ma needed!Definitely would recommend seeing her if you have to go in this location. \\xa0She\\'s courteous, very knowledgeable, patient, and has a great personality overall.This location has poor customer service, and Shor staffed.
