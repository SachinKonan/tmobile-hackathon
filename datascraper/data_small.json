At the time I was living in the Buckhead area of Atlanta. About a week ago, I purchased a home about 15 minutes from my previous location in the Kirkwood community of Atlanta. This area is very established and part of Atlanta at large. It is also about a mile from Decatur square. In other words, this isn't a rural area.Upon moving in, I noticed not having any signal whatsoever, with the exception of a few fleeting 2G instances. The phone had no data and no solid ability to make a call. I called T-Mobile to investigate. The first time I was told there was a \"trouble ticket\" currently being serviced in the area. They would get back to me after they heard the results of the repair. They did and asked me to go back to the house and see how much my service had improved.The service was the same.I called in again a couple of days later and was told a new service request would be initiated. I was to give them a few days and then call back on Friday. I complied and today is Friday. In the back of my mind I wondered why they wouldn't follow up with me.I spoke at length with a technician about the situation and after he reviewed his engineer \"notes\" he promptly said there is nothing that can be done. There were no planned upgrades for my area for the next 6 months at least and the engineers have confirmed my area has poor service. I was forwarded to \"terminations\". Once I reached this new department and told them my whole story again, they informed me I \"had two options\", the first being me finding someone to \"take on my contract for me\" or, if that was \"not an option\" I could pay the $200 cancellation fee for \"wanting to get out of my contract\". At no time during my experience with T-Mobile have I ever been spoken to so short and cold. I have enjoyed the service for the most part with little trouble(except being over-charged every month and having to call in to get credited). I of course take issue with the idea of paying the contract cancellation fee and was told that I could either \"write to t-mobile\" as they don't \"talk about cancellations over the phone \"anymore\" or I could just \"deal with it\" and pay the fee. In hopes for a remedy to this situation, my first step is to post here. If no remedy will be found, I will next offer my experience to shoppers entering the T-Mobile retail locations.

I need to get in and out,\" I thought to myself. But I held myself together and checked my mini-mirror to see if I had bits of sandwich in between my teeth in the meantime.
